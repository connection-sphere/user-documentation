# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 🔐 Should I connect my own LinkedIn account for scraping?

If you joined one of our DFY programs, then no. ConnectionSphere provides built-in LinkedIn and Email accounts for scraping and sending messages, so you don’t need to connect or risk your personal account.

This keeps your LinkedIn profile safe while still getting fresh, real-time data from the platform.

### ❓ What is a credit?

1 credit is consumed for each lead discovered that matches your order filters and includes a verified email address.

If you requested phone numbers, an additional 2 credits are used per lead that includes a direct phone number — bringing the total to 3 credits per lead with phone.

---

### ⏱️ How long does it take to get my data?

We typically scrape up to 25 new LinkedIn posts per hour.

The number of leads you receive each day depends on:

1. How many new posts appear in your LinkedIn search results every hour.
2. How many of those posts are authored by people who match your filters and have a verified email (and direct phone number, if required).

### 🎁 How many leads will I get during the trial?

During the $1 trial, you receive up to 20 credits.

The number of leads that you will receive depends if you have requested **valid email addresses** only (1 credit per lead) or **valid email addresses** and **direct phone numbers** (3 credits per lead).

---

### 📞 Do all leads include phone numbers?

It depends on your order settings:

- If you selected “only leads with phone numbers,” then yes — all your leads will include a phone number and cost 3 credits each.
- If you did not request phone numbers, then none of your leads will include one, and each lead will cost just 1 credit.

---

### 📱 Are all phone numbers mobile numbers?

Not necessarily. When available, we prioritize direct mobile numbers. However, some numbers may be landlines, company desk phones, or VoIP numbers.

---

### 📧 Are all the emails valid?

Yes. We run real-time email verification before delivering a lead. Only emails marked as "valid" are included in your list — minimizing bounce rates.

---

### 💬 What is a talk signal?

A talk signal is a clue that someone recently posted something relevant on LinkedIn, and may be open to a conversation.

For example, someone posting about hiring, launching a new service, raising funds, or celebrating a promotion. These “talk signals” help you engage leads at the right moment — when they’re most active and approachable.

---

### 🔁 Do my credits expire?

Yes, all unused credits expire at the end of each monthly billing cycle.

To maximize your plan's value, we recommend using your credits regularly throughout the month as they do not carry over to the next billing period.
