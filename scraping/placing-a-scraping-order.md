Placing an order involves 3 steps:

---

## Step 1 – Search for Relevant Posts

Start by entering keywords your ideal leads might post about.

For example: “for rent”, “launching a product”, “funding”, “hiring”.

You can also filter by job title and industry to better target the authors of those posts.

## Step 2 – Enrich with Data Points

ConnectionSphere appends extra information to each lead, such as:

- Valid Email Address ✅
- Direct Phone Number ✅
- Country & Company Headcount

Appending of verified email address has not extra cost.

Appending of direct phone nunbers will consime +2 additonal credits.
