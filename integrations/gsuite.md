![Integrations Overview](../assets/gsuite-01.png)

GSuite (now Google Workspace) integration is designed for scaling your outreach operations. By connecting your professional email domains, you can send cold emails at scale, centralize reply tracking, and manage multi-inbox outreach campaigns from a single dashboard while maintaining brand consistency and domain authority.

## Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### 1. Access the Integrations Page
Navigate to the GSuite integration page in your ConnectionSphere dashboard:
**https://connectionsphere.com/app/integrations/gsuite**

### 2. Check Available Slots
On the integrations page, you'll see the status of the GSuite service with available connection slots:

*   **Self-service slots (`self`)**: Available for your professional email connections
*   **DFY slots (`dy`)**: Managed by the ConnectionSphere team

The notation indicates:
*   `(self: X/Y)` - Your available/used self-service slots (typically 0/4 available when starting)
*   `(dy: X/Y)` - Available/used Done-For-You slots
*   Multiple slots allow connecting several email accounts for scaled outreach

### 3. Connect Your GSuite Account
Find an available **self-service** slot and click the **plus button (+)** to add your email credentials.

### 4. Enter Your Email and App Password
