![Integrations Overview](../assets/linkedin-01.png)

LinkedIn integration is your gateway to social selling at scale. By connecting LinkedIn profiles, ConnectionSphere can read feed activities, capture valuable engagement signals, and drive AI-assisted outreach through connection requests and messages, transforming your LinkedIn presence into a powerful lead generation channel.

## Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### 1. Access the Integrations Page
Navigate to the LinkedIn integration page in your ConnectionSphere dashboard:
**https://connectionsphere.com/app/integrations/linkedin**

### 2. Check Available Slots
On the integrations page, you'll see the status of the LinkedIn service with available connection slots:

*   **Self-service slots (`self`)**: Available for your profile connections
*   **DFY slots (`dly`)**: Managed by the ConnectionSphere team

The notation indicates:
*   `(self: X/Y)` - Your available/used self-service slots (typically 0/2 available when starting)
*   `(dly: X/Y)` - Available/used Done-For-You slots
*   Multiple slots allow connecting several LinkedIn accounts for scaled activities

### 3. Connect Your LinkedIn Account
Find an available **self-service** slot and click the **plus button (+)** to configure your connection.

### 4. Enter Account and Proxy Credentials

You'll need to provide your LinkedIn credentials and proxy information for secure and reliable access.

**Required Information:**
*   **Email address/username:** Your LinkedIn login email
*   **Password:** Your LinkedIn account password
*   **Proxy Setup:** Essential for avoiding detection and restrictions

**Proxy Recommendation:**
We strongly recommend using static residential proxies from **Proxy-Cheap.com** for optimal performance and reliability. Residential proxies appear as regular user connections, significantly reducing the risk of being flagged or blocked by LinkedIn.

**How the Connection Works:**
ConnectionSphere will create a dedicated browser instance with your specified proxy configuration and attempt to log in using your credentials. Note that LinkedIn may require email verification during the initial login process, so please have access to your email inbox ready.

### 5. Complete the Connection
Fill in all required fields with your proxy details and LinkedIn credentials, then click **Connect LinkedIn** to establish the connection.

### 6. Managing Your Connections
To release an occupied slot (to remove or replace a LinkedIn account), click the **Disconnect** button associated with that specific connection.
