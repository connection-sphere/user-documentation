![Integrations Overview](../assets/gmail-01.png)

GMail integration is your outreach engine. Connecting your GMail accounts allows ConnectionSphere to send personalized cold emails, track replies, and manage conversations directly from your inbox. This setup is crucial for running effective email campaigns while maintaining control over your sending domains.

## Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### 1. Access the Integrations Page
Navigate to the GMail integration page in your ConnectionSphere dashboard:
**https://connectionsphere.com/app/integrations/gmail**

### 2. Check Available Slots
On the integrations page, you'll see the status of the GMail service. The interface shows:

*   **Self-service slots (`self`)**: Available for your own email connections (marked for setup)
*   **DFY slots (`fly`)**: Managed by the ConnectionSphere team (will be filled for you)

The notation indicates:
*   `(self: X/Y)` - Your available/used self-service slots (e.g., `0/4` means 0 used, 4 available)
*   `(fly: X/Y)` - Available/used DFY slots
*   The total count shows overall connection capacity

### 3. Connect Your GMail Account
Find an available **self-service** slot and click the **plus button (+)** to add your email credentials.

### 4. Enter Your Email and App Password

    *   Select **Mail** as the app and **Other** as the device (you can name it "ConnectionSphere")
    *   Click **Generate**
    *   Copy the 16-character password that appears

3.  **Enable IMAP:**
    *   In Gmail, click the gear icon ⚙️ and select **See all settings**
